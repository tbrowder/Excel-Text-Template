# Excel::Text::Template

Use a text template to generate an 'Excel'
'.xlsx' file

## DESCRIPTION

This module provides the capability of using a text template
to generate an Excel file. It is a WIP and has no working code
at the moment. If you are interested in the concept, please
star and follow the project and file an issue.

The project uses several Perl modules which will have to
be installed for the distro to work.
